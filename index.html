		<h1>Local-First Counter</h1>

		<p>Open-source web apps are great, but downloading the app from a website every time you use it has a few big drawbacks.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>server administrator(s) can change the code at any time</li>
			<li>server administrator(s) can <em>at least</em> see your usage metadata</li>
			<li>others on your network can see your DNS queries</li>
			<li>probably a bunch of other reasons</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Instead, you should just <a class="download" href="." download>download this application</a> and run it locally.

			<p>You can test out the application below, but you should know that trusting arbitrary code from a remote server is a bad idea.</p>

			<noscript>
				<strong>Note</strong>: you have JavaScript disabled. Maybe you'd be more comfortable enabling JavaScript if you were running this app locally?

			<button type="button" onClick="increment()">i++</button>

			<p id="i">0</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				var i = localStorage.getItem('i');
				document.getElementById('i').innerHTML = i;

				function increment() {
					localStorage.setItem('i', ++i);
					document.getElementById('i').innerHTML = i;
				};
			</script>
